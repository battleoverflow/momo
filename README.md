# Momo's Quest

Momo's Quest is a C++ game using raylib!

Momo's Quest is a short story about an adventurer who wanders into the woods and encounters a horrifying BOSS battle! She'll have to battle this boss with all her might, but in the end, it's up to the player if she wins or loses. Good luck!

P.S. This game is terrible and I'm sorry. I may come back to it one day, but right now, it's this

The only requirement is to make sure `raylib` is installed on your system. If running macOS, you can use `brew`, but if you're running Windows/Linux, you may need to download the appropriate resources and update the `.vscode/*.json` files to set the directory for building/running.

Example:
```bash
brew install raylib
```

This was just a project I've been messing with over the past year when I had a few minutes, so I wouldn't expect too many updates moving forward. Feel free to download the executable in the releases to play or build from the source using the `.vscode/*` configuration.

NOTE: The map does not currently have boundaries, so feel free to run off the map
